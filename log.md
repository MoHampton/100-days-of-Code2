# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 2)

### Day 1: November 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Great start with the first module to the SharePoint Fundamentals.  Developed my first "Hello World" SharePoint Webpart with React.  I also revisited Free Code Camp and studied JavaScript under the Front End Development Certificate.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to continue learning and applying my skills from React to SharePoint.  This will require more study on React and ES6.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
