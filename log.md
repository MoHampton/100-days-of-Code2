# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 2)

---

### Day 1: November 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Great start with the first module to the SharePoint Fundamentals.  Developed my first "Hello World" SharePoint Webpart with React.  I also revisited Free Code Camp and studied JavaScript under the Front End Development Certificate.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to continue learning and applying my skills from React to SharePoint.  This will require more study on React and ES6.

### Day 2: November 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed more FreeCodeCamp JavaScript module...alomost done! Read more on SharePoint REST APIs and played in code with CRUD.

**Thoughts:** This is quite a long module, estimated to take 10 hours to complete.  The SharePoint CRUD process will more than likely be used frequently in my new job.

### Day 3: November 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The FreeCodeCamp JavaScript module is dooooonnnneee!  Moving on to Object Oriented and Functional Programming next. Broke my "Hello World" webpart to better understand how SharePoint works with React. Started reviewing SQL Database Fundamentals on the Microsoft Virtual Academy.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good about completing the JavaScript but I still have a lot to learn and topics to review as a refresher.

### Day 4: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed LeanKit Kanban tutorial and brushed up on SCRUM. Reviewed more of the SharePoint Framework and broke my "Hello World" web part for fun. 

**Thoughts:** Started my new job as a SharePoint Developer today.  My PM asked about REST APIs and I'm so glad I was able to answer his question based on studying the day before.

### Day 5: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp excercises on Object Oriented and Functional Programming and started Basic Algorithm Scripting.  Also reviewed Microsoft InfoPath Forms Services.

**Thoughts** The algorithm scripting excercises were challenging but rewarding after I completed a few -- very time consuming.  Researched InfoPath Form Services and quickly learned that Microsoft is no longer continuing development but will support the program until 2023.  The Microsoft Ignite conference in September, recommended using PowerApps as a replacement.

**Work:**
1. [Reverse A String](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/reverse-a-string)
2. [Factorialize a Number](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/factorialize-a-number)

**Training:**

### Day 6: November 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about using markdown to develop a more robust learning tracker.  Used my fellow code newbie as a reference: [Syk Houdeib's Learning Tracker](https://github.com/Syknapse/My-Learning-Tracker). Reviewed more on the JavaScript client object model in SharePoint.

**Thoughts** I'm enjoying building/updating my learning accountability tool.  I was very limited on time to study SharePoint but should have a full day available on Friday to tackle this monster.

---

### Day 7: November 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Brushed up on CSS with Flexbox Froggy and watched more SharePoint Framework videos.

**Thoughts** Took the holiday off yesterday for Thanksgiving.  I'm still uncomfortably full while I study - but this is part of my commitment to coding. :) I will hopefully have a few hours tomorrow to deep dive more into SharePoint Framework.

### Day 8: November 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More CSS fun with Grid Garden and started the Watch and Code JavaScript Course as a refresher.

**Thoughts** Decided to go back to the basics since I'm far too comfortable with CSS and JavaScript frameworks, such as Bootstrap, JQuery and React.  Going back to vanilla JS for now.

**Work:** [Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/)

**Training:** [Practical JavaScript Watch and Code](https://t.co/4aIKI9x2F5)

---

### Day 9: November 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed functions through Watch and Code, updated my portfolio website and reviewed reusable code for SharePoint webparts. 

**Thoughts** Slowly making my way through the Wand and Code tutorial.  It's pretty basic right now but good to see JS from another perspective. 

**Work:** [My Portfolio Website](https://mohampton.github.io/)

### Day 10: November 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm scripting and more Watch and Code.

**Thoughts** My attempt at the "Check for Palindromes" on FCC is pretty lack luster. I'm currently reviewing documention on String.prototype.replace() and String.prototype.toLowerCase()

**Work:** [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/check-for-palindromes)

<!--### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
