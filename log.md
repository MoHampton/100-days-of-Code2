# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 2)

---

### Day 1: November 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Great start with the first module to the SharePoint Fundamentals.  Developed my first "Hello World" SharePoint Webpart with React.  I also revisited Free Code Camp and studied JavaScript under the Front End Development Certificate.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to continue learning and applying my skills from React to SharePoint.  This will require more study on React and ES6.

---

### Day 2: November 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed more FreeCodeCamp JavaScript module...alomost done! Read more on SharePoint REST APIs and played in code with CRUD.

**Thoughts:** This is quite a long module, estimated to take 10 hours to complete.  The SharePoint CRUD process will more than likely be used frequently in my new job.

---

### Day 3: November 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The FreeCodeCamp JavaScript module is dooooonnnneee!  Moving on to Object Oriented and Functional Programming next. Broke my "Hello World" webpart to better understand how SharePoint works with React. Started reviewing SQL Database Fundamentals on the Microsoft Virtual Academy.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good about completing the JavaScript but I still have a lot to learn and topics to review as a refresher.

---

### Day 4: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed LeanKit Kanban tutorial and brushed up on SCRUM. Reviewed more of the SharePoint Framework and broke my "Hello World" web part for fun. 

**Thoughts:** Started my new job as a SharePoint Developer today.  My PM asked about REST APIs and I'm so glad I was able to answer his question based on studying the day before.

---

### Day 5: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp excercises on Object Oriented and Functional Programming and started Basic Algorithm Scripting.  Also reviewed Microsoft InfoPath Forms Services.

**Thoughts** The algorithm scripting excercises were challenging but rewarding after I completed a few -- very time consuming.  Researched InfoPath Form Services and quickly learned that Microsoft is no longer continuing development but will support the program until 2023.  The Microsoft Ignite conference in September, recommended using PowerApps as a replacement.

**Work:**

### Day 6: November 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about using markdown to develop a more robust learning tracker.  Used my fellow code newbie as a reference: [Syk Houdeib's Learning Tracker](https://github.com/Syknapse/My-Learning-Tracker). Reviewed more on the JavaScript client object model in SharePoint.

**Thoughts** I'm enjoying building/updating my learning accountability tool.  I was very limited on time to study SharePoint but should have a full day available on Friday to tackle this monster.

**Work:** [Mo's Learning Tracker (A.K.A. The site your currently reading...)](https://github.com/MoHampton/100-days-of-Code2)

---

### Day 7: November 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Brushed up on CSS with Flexbox Froggy and watched more SharePoint Framework videos.

**Thoughts** Took the holiday off yesterday for Thanksgiving.  I'm still uncomfortably full while I study - but this is part of my commitment to coding. :) I will hopefully have a few hours tomorrow to deep dive more into SharePoint Framework.

---

### Day 8: November 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More CSS fun with Grid Garden and started the Watch and Code JavaScript Course as a refresher.

**Thoughts** Decided to go back to the basics since I'm far too comfortable with CSS and JavaScript frameworks, such as Bootstrap, JQuery and React.  Going back to vanilla JS for now.

**Work:** [Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/)

**Training:** [Practical JavaScript Watch and Code](https://t.co/4aIKI9x2F5)

---

### Day 9: November 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed functions through Watch and Code, updated my portfolio website and reviewed reusable code for SharePoint webparts. 

**Thoughts** Slowly making my way through the Wand and Code tutorial.  It's pretty basic right now but good to see JS from another perspective. 

**Work:** [My Portfolio Website](https://mohampton.github.io/)

**Training:** [Practical JavaScript Watch and Code](https://t.co/4aIKI9x2F5)

---

### Day 10: November 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm scripting and more Watch and Code.

**Thoughts** My attempt at the "Check for Palindromes" on FCC is pretty lack luster. I'm currently reviewing documentation on String.prototype.replace() and String.prototype.toLowerCase()

**Work:** [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/check-for-palindromes)

**Training:** [Practical JavaScript Watch and Code](https://t.co/4aIKI9x2F5)

---

### Day 11: November 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm scripting and more Watch and Code.

**Thoughts** And BOOM! I figured out about 90% of solution prior to checking Stack Overflow.  I got tricked up a bit on how to remove the characters. And...only one video on WatchAndCode.  I spent majority of my time reviewing the Skillcrush website and ultimately purchased the freelance blueprint.  I've been approached recently to build and website and a Learning Management System (LMS).  I'm hoping to build a decent LMS on Wordpress to allow the customer to make future minor changes to the website without a developer.  I'm excited to see how this may unfold. 

**Work:** [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/check-for-palindromes)

---

### Day 12: November 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm scripting and "flip card" code.

**Thoughts** Completed the "Find the Longest Word in a String" challenge.  Additionally, I took time out today to research Github for a CSS/JavaScript flip card snippet.  This might work in a SharePoint React app that I've been thinking about.

**Work:** [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/find-the-longest-word-in-a-string)

**Code Sample:** [Flip Card Code by David Walsh](https://davidwalsh.name/css-flip)

---

### Day 13: November 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm scripting and "Print Area" JS hacking.

**Thoughts** Completed the "Title Case a Sentence" algorithm.  I forgot all about the .slice feature.  I explored and played around with slicing at different spots. Found out about a SharePoint developer that was able to dynamically print a list with the proper print area settings.  Spent quite some time translating/debugging the code.  Made some progress but I will take a deeper look tomorrow. 

**Work:** [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/title-case-a-sentence)

---

### Day 14: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: SharePoint Framework Intro Module 1 Section 4

**Thoughts** Short day on coding today.  Attempted to set up the SPFX environment on a new computer to code a new web part but had to settle on completing a module due to time constraints. 

**Work:** [SharePoint Framework Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqMh78I_NiA)

---

### Day 15: December 2, 2017

**Work:** [SharePoint Framework Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqMh78I_NiA)

---

### Day 18: December 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took time out today to review javascript code to dynamically print a contact list from a SharePoint portal site.  

**Thoughts** I'm excited to get my hands dirty...finally!

---

### Day 19: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: SharePoint Designer Training 

**Thoughts** Had fun learning how to build apps with SharePoint Designer.  This should minimize making unnecessary code when Microsoft has many out of the box options.  I learned how to make contacts, custom lists and calendars.  I have two more days of class to attend.  I truly cannot wait for tomorrow!

---

### Day 20: December 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: SharePoint Designer Training Day 2

**Thoughts** Today we focused on document libraries with custom views and spent half of the day reviewing permissions.  I found a few pockets where I could embed HTML code in advance modification areas. I will also research an infopath form that links to several different calendars, lists and document libraries.  Tomorrow will be the last day of class. :(

---

### Day 21: December 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: SharePoint Designer Training Day 3

**Thoughts** Had a crack at designing a portal page.  It was hard to wrapped my mind around the company template and not to be able to write simple HTML and CSS code to change the layout.  However, I understand how this could be useful for employees.  It eliminates code and provides drop and drag options similar to a Content Management System (CMS) similar to Wordpress and Drupal. 

---

### Day 22: December 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox Zombies

**Thoughts** I had a pretty busy weekend due to holiday functions but I'm back today.  I'm running on very little sleep, so a fun game seemed more pleasing than reading documentation or breaking something.  Today I start to learn flexbox!

**Work:** [Flexbox Zombies](https://geddski.teachable.com/p/flexbox-zombies)

---

### Day 23: December 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Print Code and Parallax in SharePoint

**Thoughts** Revisited the JS print code issue and hoping to figure a out a solution by the end of this week.  I also researched plain JS to possibly implement on a SharePoint Wiki page.  It's starting to get interesting...

---


### Day 24: December 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: React JS SharePoint Web Part

**Thoughts** Still chugging at finding a print solution at work. Tonight I messed around a bit more on the React "hello world" web part and captured video to show my work pals.  I'm hoping to get access the SPfx soon. 

**Work:** [Watch Me Learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkxMIz2_pxg)

---

### Day 25: December 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Print Code in SharePoint Web Part

**Thoughts** I was able to make a button in the content editor web part (CEWP) to easily print a custom list.  Still working on making a modal that will provide the user instructions. 

---

### Day 26: December 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Link to Modify a Custom List' s CSS

**Thoughts** Messing around with highlighting certain rows within a custom list.  I feel disadvantaged because I do not have the proper developer environment yet. 

---

### Day 27: December 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: First SharePoint Development Win!

**Thoughts** I experienced my first win today with SharePoint!  I was able to finally produce a button to open a modal that would give the user a choice of which columns to include in the print of the phone roster contact list.  Now if I can get the JSLink for formatting the CSS attributes...I will be one happy camper

---

### Day 28: December 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learn Enough Text Editor

**Thoughts** I really like the format of the Learn Enough Text Editor tutorial.  I might start again at the beginning with the command line tut.  It doesn't hurt to have a refresher.  I miss yesterday due to a holiday party but plan on coding a bit later tonight on FCC algorithms.

**Training:** [LE Text Editor](https://www.learnenough.com/text-editor-tutorial)

---
### Day 29: December 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Security+ Training

**Thoughts** This week I will take a pause from coding to focus on obtaining a Security+ Certification, a requirement for my current position.  Today we focused on Domain 1 & 2.

**Training:** [Security+ Certification Objectives](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/comptia-security-sy0-401.pdf)

---

### Day 30: December 19, 2017

**Thoughts** Completed Domain 2 and learned about subnetting.

**Training:** [Security+ Certification Objectives](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/comptia-security-sy0-401.pdf)

---

### Day 31: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Happy New Year!

**Thoughts** Wow! My holiday break was much needed by I took a little too much time away from my daily logging.  I've been quite busy with my new developer position and I LOVE every moment of it.  During the time away, I made a work code repository and starting building a demo library for SharePoint administrators.  I'm strengthening my JavaScript skills almost every day, however, I need to return to JS tutorials.  This weekend my focus will be on preparing for my Security+ certification.  Fingers crossed on passing the exam next week.

### Day 35: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Let's just say it's Day 35 and move forward, okay? Focusing on JS conditionals today.

**Thoughts** Seriously, I've been in over my head in code, in a good way.  Recently I received a Challenge Scholarship from Google and I could not be more grateful! I'm about 45% done with the course and it's only been about 10 days.  I will slow down on the JS portion and actually focus on the fundamentals again.  Oh, and did I mention that I'm also participating in the CodeNewbie Challenge.  Of course I chose to participate in the "Code More" track.  This week I will lay out my goals for the upcoming week, and possibly year.

### Day 36: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: #GWG JavaScript Conditionals & #CNC2018 Goals.

**Thoughts** I was able to complete the conditionals tutorial and now I'm moving on to one of my favorites...LOOPS!  It is so refreshing to go back to the basics and discover information you brushed past the first time.  I also made some time to review the #CNC2018 challenge goals.

### Day 37: January 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Bootstrap Scrollspy

**Thoughts** I developed a decent navigation menu on SharePoint to guide the user through different sections of a SharePoint page.  This took more time than I estimated by the finished product was worth it.

**Work:** 
[Bootstrap Scrollspy Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/scrollspy/)

---

### Day 38: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Contact Page Framework

**Thoughts** Built a dashboard comprised of profile image tiles that provides contact details on a modal after clicking the picture. I found a good template, listed below.  

**Work:** 
[Bootstrap Dashboard Template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin/)

---

### Day 39: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: SPServices

**Thoughts** Today was the first time I was able to use SPServices to make API calls from a SharePoint list into the Bootstrap framework.  There were a few glitches but I was finally able to retrieve the data.  The last step is to run a for loop through each list item and place images on a grid.  Whew!  Hopefully I will be able to complete this task on Monday. 

**Work:** 
[Bootstrap Dashboard Template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin/)

---

### Day 40: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: JSON APIs

**Thoughts** Finally, a BREAKTHROUGH! I tested the API call on Bootstrap cards and was able to dynamically make each card that would trigger a modal with the corresponding information.  I used bootstrap grid and [open API](https://docs.openaq.org/) for air quality.

**Work:**

---

### Day 42: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Grow With Google: JS Loops & Project Complete! 

**Thoughts** Today was exciting!  I was anxious to start working in the office on my contacts list project.  With the help of a SharePoint Developer Vet, I was able to make an image card for each contact that corresponded with a modal containing contact information.  You could even click the hyperlink and email them directly!  Yes!  Tomorrow, I will work on the CSS to make it more presentable...and I might even add flip-card animation. :)  Tonight, I will knock out another lesson on Udacity for my Grow w/Google scholarship.  Full speed adhead!

### Day 43: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Grow With Google: JS Functions & Yearbook Group Collaboration 

**Thoughts** Still riding on a coding high... I completed the JS loops and moved forward to the functions lesson. And here is where the fun begins...a group of students were interested in building a Grow With Google 2018 Front End Web Developers Yearbook.  I got my hands dirty and built a few animated cards leveraging the lessons learned from my work project. I hate to say it, but the cards look so much better outside of SharePoint.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
