# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 2)

---

### Day 1: November 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Great start with the first module to the SharePoint Fundamentals.  Developed my first "Hello World" SharePoint Webpart with React.  I also revisited Free Code Camp and studied JavaScript under the Front End Development Certificate.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to continue learning and applying my skills from React to SharePoint.  This will require more study on React and ES6.

### Day 2: November 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed more FreeCodeCamp JavaScript module...alomost done! Read more on SharePoint REST APIs and played in code with CRUD.

**Thoughts:** This is quite a long module, estimated to take 10 hours to complete.  The SharePoint CRUD process will more than likely be used frequently in my new job.

### Day 3: November 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The FreeCodeCamp JavaScript module is dooooonnnneee!  Moving on to Object Oriented and Functional Programming next. Broke my "Hello World" webpart to better understand how SharePoint works with React. Started reviewing SQL Database Fundamentals on the Microsoft Virtual Academy.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good about completing the JavaScript but I still have a lot to learn and topics to review as a refresher.

### Day 4: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed LeanKit Kanban tutorial and brushed up on SCRUM. Reviewed more of the SharePoint Framework and broke my "Hello World" web part for fun. 

**Thoughts:** Started my new job as a SharePoint Developer today.  My PM asked about REST APIs and I'm so glad I was able to answer his question based on studying the day before.

### Day 5: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed FreeCodeCamp excercises on Object Oriented and Functional Programming and started Basic Algorithm Scripting.  Also reviewed Microsoft InfoPath Forms Services.

**Thoughts** The algorithm scripting excercises were challenging but rewarding after I completed a few -- very time consuming.  Researched InfoPath Form Services and quickly learned that Microsoft is no longer continuing development but will support the program until 2023.  The Microsoft Ignite conference in September, recommended using PowerApps as a replacement.

**Work:**

### Day 6: November 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about using markdown to develop a more robust learning tracker.  Used my fellow code newbie as a reference: [Syk Houdeib's Learning Tracker](https://github.com/Syknapse/My-Learning-Tracker). Reviewed more on the JavaScript client object model in SharePoint.

**Thoughts** I'm enjoying building/updating my learning accountability tool.  I was very limited on time to study SharePoint but should have a full day available on Friday to tackle this monster.

---

### Day 7: November 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Brushed up on CSS with Flexbox Froggy and watched more SharePoint Framework videos.

**Thoughts** Took the holiday off yesterday for Thanksgiving.  I'm still uncomfortably full while I study - but this is part of my commitment to coding. :) I will hopefully have a few hours tomorrow to deep dive more into SharePoint Framework.

---

### Day 8: November 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More CSS fun with Grid Garden and started the Watch and Code JavaScript Course as a refresher.

**Thoughts** Decided to go back to the basics since I'm far too comfortable with CSS and JavaScript frameworks, such as Bootstrap, JQuery and React.  Going back to vanilla JS for now.

**Work:** [Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/)

**Training:** [Practical JavaScript Watch and Code](https://t.co/4aIKI9x2F5)

---

### Day 9: November 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed functions through Watch and Code, updated my portfolio website and reviewed reusable code for SharePoint webparts. 

**Thoughts** Slowly making my way through the Wand and Code tutorial.  It's pretty basic right now but good to see JS from another perspective. 

**Work:** [My Portfolio Website](https://mohampton.github.io/)

---

### Day 10: November 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm scripting and more Watch and Code.

**Thoughts** My attempt at the "Check for Palindromes" on FCC is pretty lack luster. I'm currently reviewing documention on String.prototype.replace() and String.prototype.toLowerCase()

**Work:** [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/check-for-palindromes)

**Training:** [Practical JavaScript Watch and Code](https://t.co/4aIKI9x2F5)

---

### Day 11: November 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm scripting and more Watch and Code.

**Thoughts** And BOOM! I figured out about 90% of soluation prior to checking Stack Overflow.  I got tricked up a bit on how to remove the characters. And...only one video on WatchAndCode.  I spent majority of my time reviewing the Skillcrush website and ultimately purchased the freelance blueprint.  I've been approached recently to build and website and a Learning Management System (LMS).  I'm hoping to build a decent LMS on Wordpress to allow the customer to make future minor changes to the website without a developer.  I'm excited to see how this may unfold.

### Day 12: November 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm scripting and "flip card" code.

**Thoughts** Completed the "Find the Longest Word in a String" challenge.  Additionally, I took time out today to research Github for a CSS/JavaScript flip card snippet.  This might work in a SharePoint React app that I've been thinking about.

**Work:** [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/find-the-longest-word-in-a-string)

---

### Day 13: November 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm scripting and "Print Area" JS hacking.

**Thoughts** Completed the "Title Case a Sentence" algorithm.  I forgot all about the .slice feature.  I explored and played around with slicing at different spots. Found out about a SharePoint developer that was able to dynamically print a list with the proper print area settings.  Spent quite some time translating/debugging the code.  Made some progress but I will take a deeper look tomorrow. 

**Work:** [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/title-case-a-sentence)

### Day 14: December 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: SharePoint Framework Intro Module 1 Section 4

**Thoughts** Short day on coding today.  Attempted to set up the SPFX environment on a new computer to code a new web part but had to settle on completing a module due to time contraints. 

**Work:** [SharePoint Framework Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqMh78I_NiA)

---

### Day 15: December 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Watch And Code Objects

**Thoughts** Completed the Watch And Code Objects tutorial 

**Training:** [Practical JavaScript Watch and Code](https://t.co/4aIKI9x2F5)

**Thoughts** Completed Module 2 Sections 1 & 2 

**Work:** [SharePoint Framework Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqMh78I_NiA)

---

### Day 18: December 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took time out today to review javascript code to dynamically print a contact list from a SharePoint portal site.  

**Thoughts** I'm excited to get my hands dirty...finally!

---

### Day 19: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: SharePoint Designer Training 

**Thoughts** Had fun learing how to build apps with SharePoint Desinger.  This should minimize making unneccessary code when Microsoft has many out of the box options.  I learned how to make contacts, custom lists and calendars.  I have two more days of class to attend.  I truly cannot wait for tomorrow!

---

### Day 20: December 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: SharePoint Designer Training Day 2

**Thoughts** Today we focused on document librarys with custom views and spent half of the day reviewing permissions.  I found a few pockets where I could embed HTML code in advance modification areas. I will also research an infopath form that links to several different calendars, lists and document libraries.  Tomorrow will be the last day of class. :(

---

### Day 21: December 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: SharePoint Designer Training Day 3

**Thoughts** Had a crack at designing a portal page.  It was hard to wrapped my mind around the company template and not to be able to write simple HTML and CSS code to change the layout.  However, I understand how this could be useful for employees.  It eleminates code and provides drop and drag options similar to a Content Management System (CMS) similar to Wordpress and Drupal. 

---

### Day 22: December 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Flexbox Zombiies

**Thoughts** I had a pretty busy weekend due to holiday functions but I'm back today.  I'm running on very little sleep, so a fun game seemed more pleasing than reading documentation or breaking something.  Today I start to learn flexbox!

**Work:** [Flexbox Zombies](https://geddski.teachable.com/p/flexbox-zombies)

---

### Day 23: December 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Print Code and Parallax in SharePoint

**Thoughts** Revisited the JS print code issue and hoping to figure a out a solution by the end of this week.  I also researched plain JS to possibly implement on a SharePoint Wiki page.  It's starting to get interesting...

---


### Day 24: December 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: React JS SharePoint Web Part

**Thoughts** Still chugging at finding a print solution at work. Tonight I messed around a bit more on the React "hello world" web part and caputured video to show my work pals.  I'm hoping to get access the SPfx soon. 

**Work:** [Watch Me Learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkxMIz2_pxg)

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
